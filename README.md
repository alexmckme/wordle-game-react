# Wordle Game in React

This project is a simple reproduction of the popular online word game, Wordle.

In Wordle, users have 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter word. You're helped along the way by ruling out letters that aren't in the word, and being told whether the correct letters are in the correct location or not.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:**  **React** (with Parcel)

This project was made as part of "Joy of React" by Joshua W. Comeau, one of the highly acclaimed premium React courses at the time of writing.

## Optimizations

- Feature: add a "restart" button to allow the player to start a new game without having to refresh the page
- Feature: allow the player to adjust the number of allowed guesses
- Feature: show a keyboard below the guesses

## Lessons Learned:

This project's primary purpose was to apply my newly acquired skills of modern React, working with state, props, and form data, resulting in this fun little game.
